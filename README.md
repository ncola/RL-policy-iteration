# RL-policy-iteration

This repository contains source code (helper.py) and materials related to the task of dynamic programming - policy iteration.

## Task
The task is derived from the Reinforcement Learning Classes course. The full materials and instructions for this task can be found at: [https://github.com/PrzemekSekula/ReinforcementLearningClasses/tree/main/DynamicProgramming](https://github.com/PrzemekSekula/ReinforcementLearningClasses/tree/main/DynamicProgramming).

## Description
In this task, I implement policy iteration in the context of dynamic programming. The policy iteration algorithm involves iteratively updating state values and improving the policy to find an optimal strategy.
